# Landscape-scale Validation

ELMFIRE is designed for landscape-scale fire spread prediction and risk analysis. The validation tests will therefore focus on: (1) assessing the accuracy of fire propagation dynamics by comparing model predictions with historical fire events, and (2) evaluating whether the risk analysis framework produces predictions consistent with estimates derived from historical data.
