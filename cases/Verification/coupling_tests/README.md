# Coupling Tests

The tests included in this folder are designed to evaluate the coupled behavior of multiple subroutines through more complex cases. For example, the subroutine LEVEL_SET_PROPAGATION in elmfire_level_set.f90 invokes numerous other subroutines and functions, making simple inputâ€“output verification infeasible. Instead, synthetic scenarios with known solutions will be constructed. Given the complexity of these functions, verification cannot be achieved through a single case; rather, a suite of cases will be developed to assess their behavior under varying conditions. Although it is not possible to anticipate all error-inducing situations, this category of test cases will remain adaptive, with new cases added whenever problems are identified and resolved. If addressing such problems requires introducing new independent subroutines or functions, those components will also be subjected to functionality verification through independent unit tests.
